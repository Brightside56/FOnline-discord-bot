***Greetings tester! 

The NFSW-Freetalk channel, albeit not very moderated, it still has limits - There are just things that nobody wants to see.
What you shouldn't do is listed below.

Do not post anything including:
 - Gore.
 - Anything including male genitals.
 - Fat naked people.
 - Straight out disgusting porn or beyond boundaries.
 - Disgusting things, excrements, you well know where things get fucked up unless you're sick - If you are. Just for your own sake, do not post any pictures.

You should not:
 - Post people's private information.
 - Spam/act like a complete retard.

This channel despite being on Fonline2 Discord is not representative of Developer team beliefs or opinions. 
 
We are all gentlemen. Let's at least try to respect each other.

Punishments are chaotic. Sometimes you'll get a warning, get another one then get kicked out, sometimes you will be straight out banned from the room. And sometimes it will be completely ignored, you'll learn where the borders are by staying in here for a while.

Summing things up. This channel is for more relaxed, playful chat, It doesn't mean we want it to evolve into 4chan retardedness level.***
